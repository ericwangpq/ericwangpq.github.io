Hi there <img src='https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/24524555/238178097-766d336d-b87d-44ba-807c-c51de2bc6b4d.gif' alt='hello' style='width: auto; height: 1em;'>! I am Pengqi (Eric) Wang, a Ph. D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at OSU, advised by <a href="https://www.pingzhang.net/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Ping Zhang</a> and <a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/non-clinical/biomedical-informatics/weidan-cao" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Weidan Cao</a>. I received my M. Phil. degree from HKUST, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.mingmingfan.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Mingming FAN</a> and <a href="https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/people/muzhi-zhou" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Muzhi ZHOU</a> in <a href="https://www.mingmingfan.com/lab/" style="text-decoration: none;">APEX Lab</a>. I received my B.B.A. in e-Business Management and Information Systems (First Class), with minor in Computer Science and Technology from HKBU where I was advised by <a href="https://staff.uic.edu.cn/ywang/en" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. May Ying WANG</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chaijunyi/home" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Don Junyi CHAI</a>. 

My research interests are designing interactive systems and empirically exploring user interactions in **Human-AI Collaboration**, **Educational Technology**, and **E-Business**. I aim to bridge the gap between users and AI technologies by developing AI-powered tools that enhance learning experiences, facilitate effective collaboration, and improve user engagement on digital platforms, with the goal of fostering trust, accessibility, and efficiency in human-computer interactions.
