Hi there <img src='https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/24524555/238178097-766d336d-b87d-44ba-807c-c51de2bc6b4d.gif' alt='hello' style='width: auto; height: 1em;'>! I am Pengqi (Eric) Wang, an M. Phil. student at HKUST, supervised by [Prof. Mingming FAN](https://mingmingfan.com/) and [Prof. Muzhi ZHOU](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/people/muzhi-zhou). I received my B.B.A. in e-Business Management and Information Systems (First Class), with minor in Computer Science and Technology from HKBU in 2023 where I was advised by [Prof. May Ying WANG](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/ywang/en) and [Prof. Don Junyi CHAI](https://sites.google.com/view/chaijunyi/home). 

My research interests are designing interactive systems and empirically exploring user interactions in **Human-AI Collaboration**, **Educational Technology**, and **E-Business**. I aim to bridge the gap between users and AI technologies by developing AI-powered tools that enhance learning experiences, facilitate effective collaboration, and improve user engagement on digital platforms, with the goal of fostering trust, accessibility, and efficiency in human-computer interactions.
