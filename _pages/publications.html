        <p>College students access information from diverse sources like academic databases, social media, and textbooks. This varied landscape
          offers more learning opportunities but also challenges, including source credibility asessment and information integration. AI tools
          have the potential to alleviate these challenges by streamlining information processes for students. However, existing AI tools are not
          yet optimized for handling multi-source information challenges in academic settings. To address this gap, we conducted a two-phase
          study. Firstly, we conducted focus group workshops to explore students’ multi-source information behaviors in AI-assisted learning
          environments. Secondly, we held participatory design workshops to gather design considerations to address current challenges. Our
          analysis revealed a framework of students’ multi-source information behaviors comprising four key phases: Search, Read, Extract,
          and Manage. These insights provide practical guidance for enhancing AI-assisted academic tools, ultimately improving students’
          multi-source information retrieval and management experiences.</p>

        <p>Qianjie WEI, Jingling ZHANG, <strong>Pengqi WANG</strong>, Xiaofu JIN, Mingming FAN</p>
        <p>The 17th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction <em>(VINCI)</em>, 2024</p>

        <p>Despite the rise of digital libraries and online reading platforms, physical libraries still offer unique benefits for education and community engagement. However, due to the convenience of digital resources, physical library visits, especially by college students, have declined. This underscores the need to better engage these users. Augmented Reality (AR) could potentially bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. In this paper, we present \textit{Augmented Library}, an HMD-based AR system designed to revitalize the physical library experience. By creating interactive features that enhance book discovery, encourage community engagement, and cater to diverse user needs, \textit{Augmented Library} combines digital convenience with physical libraries' rich experiences. This paper discusses the development of the system and preliminary user feedback on its impact on student engagement in physical libraries.</p>
